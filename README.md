# Text Editor in C
  I made this simple text editor by following some tutorials online.

  The main purpose to this is to use it with another project from univerisity where we (me and my group) are building a computer from scratch using the x86 architecture.
## How to use
It is easier to use with Make (optional)


### Windows
  You will need to use WSL (windows subsystem for linux) to run this text editor.
  
  Run this in your powershell:
  ```
   wsl --install 
 ```
And this in your linux terminal:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
### Linux
  
  You can simply clone the repository and run it in your terminal :)
